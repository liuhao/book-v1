Used by DriverUtilities2. Here you configure information
about your database server in XML. To add a driver, include
a vendor keyword, description, driver-class, and URL.
For general use, the host and database name should not
be included in the URL; a special notation is required
for the host and database name. Use [$host] as a 
placeholder for the host server and [$dbName] as a placeholder
for the database name. Specify the actual host and database name
when making a call to makeUrl (DriverUtilities). Then, the 
appropriate strings will be substituted for [$host]
and [$dbName] before the URL is returned.
